<h2>Financial Risk Types</h2>
<div id="tabs">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#tabs-1">Credit risk</a></li>
        <li><a href="#tabs-2">Interest rate risk</a></li>
        <li><a href="#tabs-3">Market risk</a></li>
        <li><a href="#tabs-4">Liquidity risk</a></li>
    </ul>
    <div id="tabs-1">
        <p>The possibility that an investment will lose value owing to declining financial strength in the underlying
            company is referred to as credit risk. Default risk is one component, referring to the potential for a
            financially weakened company to default on its payments of interest and principal to bond holders and an
            eventual collapse of the enterprise, which makes the stock worthless. High credit risk, whether in terms of
            securities investments or consumer and corporate loans, leads to high interest rates to compensate for the
            potential of late payments or total default.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="tabs-2">
        <p> Economic conditions cause interest rate risk. When the Federal Reserve decides that the economy has
            overheated to a point that inflation is a risk, it will institute restrictive monetary policy. This consists
            of removing money from the system and raising interest rates. Higher interest rates cause the market price
            of bonds to decline. When the economy is in recession, the Fed will institute expansionary monetary policy,
            adding money to the system and lowering interest rates. This form of interest rate risk primarily affects
            banks because they get the money they loan out through certificates of deposit and savings accounts. If they
            write one-year CDs at 8 percent and interest rates drop quickly, they may be lending that money out at 6
            percent and losing money until the CDs mature and they can replace those deposits at 4 percent or lower with
            new CDs. Inflation risk is a function of Fed monetary policy and can also be considered part of interest
            rate risk.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="tabs-3">
        <p>A catastrophic event that causes a market reaction, either up or down, is one example of market risk. Changes
            in Fed policy, changes in the economy as evidenced in the monthly publication of various economic indicator
            statistics, surprising earnings reports from major companies that indicate weakness in key industries and
            normal market consolidations are all market risks. </p>
        <p>They affect the price of investments and, depending on
            whether you own stock or bonds, are net short (sold without owning in anticipation of a drop in the market
            price) or long (own in anticipation of a rise in the market price) your investments, you can expect to
            experience market risk.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="tabs-4">
        <p>Some investments, such as private purchases of non-trading stock, are not liquid -- they cannot easily be
            sold. Other investments, such as very small issues of publicly trading stock, are not easy to sell because
            the stock does not trade on a daily basis because not many people are interested in buying it. Other
            instances of illiquidity happen when a company is rumored to be on the verge of bankruptcy, experiences a
            drastic event or trading is halted because of imbalance between the volume of shares for sale and the volume
            of purchase orders. Liquidity risk affects your ability to quickly sell your securities and may affect the
            price you receive.</p>
