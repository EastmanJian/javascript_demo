<!DOCTYPE html>

<body>

<p>
    JavaScript can write to the out stream of HTML directly.
</p>

<script>
    document.write("<h1>This is a heading</h1>");
    document.write("<p>This is a paragraph.</p>");
</script>

<p>
    You can only use <strong>document.write</strong> in the HTML out stream.
    If you use it after the document is load, it will override all document.
